# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis

This project focuses on **predictive analysis of social media's impact on mental health** using **machine learning** techniques.  
The primary model used is **Logistic Regression**, trained on a survey dataset to classify mental health outcomes.

---

## 🔎 Project Overview
The analysis follows major machine learning workflow steps:

- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Understanding dataset patterns and distributions  
- 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing data for modeling  
- 🤖 **Model Training** – Applying Logistic Regression for prediction  

The choice of Logistic Regression was made due to its **simplicity** and **suitability for binary classification problems**.

---

## 📈 Future Scope
- Expansion to **larger and more diverse datasets**  
- Exploration of **advanced machine learning models** for deeper insights  
- Integration with **real-time social media data**
